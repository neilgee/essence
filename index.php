				<p>You’re not alone. Many Christians experience these everyday. Well-known people in the bible – even significant leaders – struggled with these issues.</p>
<p>There’s good news. You don’t have to struggle with these things anymore – even if you’ve dealt with them for a long time.</p>
<p>You can be free of the frustration and tiredness of trying to live up to the expectations you think God or people have of you.</p>
<p>You can remove the heavy burdens and nagging feelings of disappointment, condemnation and guilt – today.</p>
<p>You can know God’s heart for you and enjoy the relationship with Him you’ve always wanted.</p>
<p>And you can serve God from a place of confidence, assurance and joy knowing His approval, acceptance, and favor is not based on what you do or how good you are.</p>

				<h3>What Can Essence Do For You?</h3>

I’ve witnessed the biblical truths compiled in this Essence course transform believers and trigger radical improvement in their relationship with God. This Essence course will help you understand the person and work of Christ and walk in the reality of His wonderful and gracious work everyday.</p>

<blockquote><p>Your teaching has been a truly life changing journey for me. It has changed the way I see God, myself, my worth, the church and ministry, and my attitude when coming before God. I never realised how much I worked for my salvation. I feel like there is so much more joy in my walk with God, and peace inside me knowing who I am in Him.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This teaching has honestly been one of the most life changing messages that I've heard. My relationship with God has grown beyond anything I could have ever imagined. I can now spend time with God without feeling guilty or ashamed. I know that I can come to God with anything and everything. To put it simply, I now understand who I am in God and how I relate to God.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This teaching not only gave me new revelations – more than that – it changed my Christian beliefs and my foundation in Christ totally. As a long-term Christian I had forgotten the very basics and was defining my relationship with God by the things I did: my behavior, my work in the church and my activities for Christ. But I lost what Christ did for me. My journey of freedom has just begun.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The revelation I received from your teaching has completely set me free. Free from living a life of working for my salvation. A burden was lifted off my shoulders. I finally saw myself as God sees me.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the 21 years of being in church (and after having come from a strict Catholic background/upbringing), I never recall being taught anywhere near the level that you took us through.  I really had no idea that I was bound by a 'works' based approach to my faith.  I was moved to tears many times and it was like a weight was lifted from my mind and my heart.  I have battled anxiety and depression for some years and it was like being able to draw a breath finally rather than scrambling to just stay afloat!  Thank you for your teaching - I know that it changed the course of my life.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The value added to my walk with God and even life in general was immense.  The burdens I have been able to offload because of the freedom that comes from understanding all that Christ’s life has done for us have been many.  Thank you for bringing clarity to my faith and enabling me to articulate it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>During my early years as a Christian, I lived in a constant state of self-accusation, condemnation, and punishment.  This came from having grown-up in a household with catholic Parents, who were high achieving and would discipline us whenever we failed to live up to certain level of academic performance.  When I first met Jesus, in those early years, I lived in this same state of continuous torment.  I now realize I saw God the Father in the same way I saw my natural father – a God that was punishing me whenever I did something wrong.  I lived under a perpetual state of self-accusation and feeling bad about myself.  This felt like a mental prison.</p>
<p>Brett’s teaching began to change the way I saw God, and, ultimately, affected the way I would see myself.  I finally started to understand for the first time that my standing with God had nothing to do with my behavior or performance. One of my favorite teachings is the one regarding the covenant promise the Lord makes to Abraham. A picture was painted in my mind that has never left me.</p>
<p>After listening, studying and spending time reading the bible as a follow-up to Brett’s teachings, I can finally say that I no longer feel bad. I finally feel joyful, and can relax in my relationships.  Through his teaching, I am now able to encounter and receive the unconditional love of my Father in Heaven – freeing to be myself in the context of my relationship with God, and with others.  I laugh more than I ever have before.  I now spend more time looking to God, and what he has done for me, rather than meditating on my shortcomings.</p></blockquote>
